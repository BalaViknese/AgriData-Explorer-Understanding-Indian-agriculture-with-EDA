#AgriData Explorer – District-Level Crop Analytics in India

##Project Overview

**AgriData Explorer** is an end-to-end data analytics project aimed at understanding and visualizing the agricultural performance of Indian districts using data from ICRISAT. The project covers **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis**, **predictive modeling**, **SQL querying**, and **interactive dashboards in Power BI**.

##Dataset

**Source:** [ICRISAT - District Level Crop Data](https://www.icrisat.org)

###Dataset Includes:
- Crop-wise area cultivated, production, and yield
- Time range: multiple years (historical)
- Granularity: District-level across Indian states
- Crops covered: Rice, Wheat, Maize, Groundnut, Oilseeds, Sugarcane, Cotton, Millets, Sorghum, Soybean, Sunflower, and others

---

##Problem Statement

To build an interactive and intelligent system that helps:
- Identify top-performing districts and states by crop
- Analyze historical trends in production and yield
- Predict future production (e.g., Groundnut in 2020)
- Enable real-time data exploration via dashboards
- Recommend high-performing crops per region

##Project Workflow

###1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)
- Replaced all `-1` values with `0` to handle invalid entries
- Standardized column names (snake_case)
- Removed duplicates and missing values
- Saved as `ICRISATcleaned.csv`

###2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Plots created using `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly`:
- Top 5 Wheat Producing States (Bar + Pie Chart)
- Sunflower, Sugarcane, Millet, Sorghum Trends
- Crop-wise production trends over 50 years
- Yield comparison between Rice and Wheat
- Groundnut Production by State & District

###3. SQL Analysis (MySQL)
Used a normalized SQL table (`agri_data`) inside the database `indian_agri`. Example queries:
- Top 5 districts by wheat yield increase over 5 years
- Cotton production growth by state
- Yearly rice production by top 3 states
- Groundnut production prediction for 2020 (via Python)

###4. Predictive Modeling (Optional)
- Used `LinearRegression` from `sklearn` to predict missing 2020 groundnut production per district
- Saved predictions to `groundnut_prediction_2020.csv`

###5. Power BI Dashboard
Key features:
- Filled Maps showing regional production
- Slicers for Year, Crop, State
- KPIs for Yield, Area, Production
- Trend Charts (line, area, column)
- Interactive comparisons (Rice vs Wheat, etc.)
